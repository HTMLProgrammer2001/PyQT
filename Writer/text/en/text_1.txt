The "Great Desert" was the name given to the northern part of Africa on medieval nautical charts. The name "Sahara" then applied only to the western and central parts of the territory. The length of dune chains in the Sahara can reach 5 km and a height of 400 m. In some parts of the Sahara, rain can be expected for years or even decades. And even then, the rain may not reach the ground, as the drops may evaporate in flight.
